## Bash Bingo!

A fun way to learn bash commands!

### How to play

1. Use the `make_board.rb` script to generate boards. Each player should have at
   least one board. The odds of having a winner will be higher if you give each
   person multiple boards. Print out boards.
1. For facilitator: Use `bash-bingo.key` if you can, since it has answers in the
   speaker notes. If you want to figure it out all together, use the PDF.

## TO DO

Add more commands (currently have 42). [Mathematical simulations](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/281173/expected-number-of-calls-for-bingo-win)
suggest that the optimal number of calls is somewhere between 58-63, to nearly
guarantee that someone will win.

Possible ones to add:

* awk
* xargs
* watch
* gunzip
* base64
* md5sum
* sha256sum
* openssl
* chgrp
* tail
* head
* netstat
* useradd
* uptime
* mount
* yes
* apt-get and some pkg mgrs?
* jq? (Not core, but v useful)
